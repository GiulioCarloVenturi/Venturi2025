# Central Bank Digital Currency: Payment Systems and Fees
## Abstract
This paper quantitatively evaluates the implications of competition between a retail interest-bearing central bank digital currency (CBDC) and traditional forms of money (deposit and cash). In order to provide a more realistic representation of payment networks’ complexity, the analysis explicitly takes into account resource costs and fees generated by payment instruments. Calibration to four advanced economies suggests that CBDC might raise output by 0.32 – 1.45%, and that the optimal CBDC design shall target a cost structure similar to that of debit card networks. A non-interest bearing CBDC that is sufficiently less expensive than
bank deposits can still affect the economy, albeit with attenuated effect.
